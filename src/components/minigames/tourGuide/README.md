placeholder for autum Tour Guide scheduling game; forms are randomly generated with a request and the player must assign them to the right tour and time slot. The game lasts for a half-day or 4 hours of touring with each tour taking up an hour so there are 16 tour slots to fill, i.e. 10am for Botanic tour, 10am for Historic tour, 10am for Gastronic tour, 10am for Boat tour; 12pm for each, 2pm for each, 4pm for each. For each tour and time slot, there's a minimum of 6 guests and a maximum of 15 guests. As the day-clock of the game timer starts at 8am to receive requests and gets new requests up until the last tour time slot starts at 4pm. The objective is for the player to assign the tour requests to the slots to optimize the number of guests served while limited by the timing of when requests are received, tours closing as the day-clock progresses, and tours are either successfully completed with the right number of guests or cancelled if the minimum wasn't reached or the maximum exceeded.
